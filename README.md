# CodSoft Internship Projects â€“ Python

This repository contains the projects I completed during my internship with **CodSoft**, where I explored core Python concepts by developing real-world applications. Each project demonstrates practical problem-solving, user interaction, and functionality.

## ğŸ”¹ Project 1: To-Do List Application
A simple yet functional To-Do List built using Python that allows users to add, update, and track daily tasks. This project helped me understand basic CRUD operations, user input handling, and data management in Python.

## ğŸ”¹ Project 2: Password Generator
A customizable password generator where users can choose the length and complexity of passwords. This project enhanced my skills in working with Python libraries like `random` and `string`, and improving user experience with logical branching.

## ğŸ”¹ Project 3: Contact Book (GUI)
A fully functional Contact Book application using `Tkinter` that enables users to add, view, update, search, and delete contact information. It taught me GUI design principles, data structure usage, and event-driven programming.
